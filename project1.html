    <h2>Modular Radiation Containment</h2>
    <p>
      This project was developed in collaboration with the Naval Nuclear Laboratory 
      (NNL) to design and prototype a modular radiological containment system. 
      Current solutions such as glove boxes and glove bags are either too bulky or 
      too fragile for unique, one-off containment scenarios. Our system was designed to 
      be airtight, watertight, modular, and easy to assemble, while maintaining the 
      rigorous safety standards required for radiological work.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      NNL required a flexible containment solution that could be deployed quickly 
      for non-routine operations. Existing gloveboxes and glovebags lacked adaptability, 
      leading to increased setup times, operational delays, and higher safety risks.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Airtight and watertight seals</li>
      <li>Assembly time target: 1 hour (max 3 hours)</li>
      <li>Panel weight under 20 lbs (max 50 lbs)</li>
      <li>Reusable modular design using T-slot frames and acrylic panels</li>
      <li>Integrated ports: glove, swipe, transfer sleeve, HEPA filter, and vacuum</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Detailed system design package with CAD models and documentation</li>
      <li>Functioning prototype matching requirements</li>
      <li>Final report including testing, budget, and recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>System Design</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Acrylic panels in T-slot aluminum frames</li>
      <li>Glove Ports – ergonomic manipulation of materials</li>
      <li>Swipe Port – safe introduction of tools and items</li>
      <li>Transfer Sleeve – removal of contaminated materials</li>
      <li>HEPA Filter & Vacuum Port – negative pressure containment and air safety</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Key Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Airtight & Watertight: Passed leak tests with zero leaks</li>
      <li>Setup Time: 1-hour assembly with three operators</li>
      <li>Weight: Panels averaged 14.6 lbs (under 50 lbs limit)</li>
      <li>Cost: Completed under budget at $4757.04 (budget cap $5000)</li>
      <li>Performance: Met all containment and usability requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Design Impact & Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Aligned with DOE radiological safety standards</li>
      <li>Ergonomic glove port placement for operator comfort</li>
      <li>Environmental protection against radiological release</li>
      <li>Cost-effective, lightweight materials for ease of production</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
    Throughout the design and prototyping process, our team gained valuable insight 
    into the importance of communication, testing, and iteration. Early prototypes 
    revealed sealing issues that required multiple redesigns, emphasizing how 
    critical it is to validate concepts quickly. We also learned that clear internal 
    communication and well-defined responsibilities are essential for avoiding delays. 
    Adjustments to assembly methods, sealing strategies, and fabrication procedures 
    significantly improved performance, showing the value of flexibility and adaptability 
    during the design cycle. Moving forward, considerations such as glove ergonomics, 
    smoother interior surfaces, and integrated mobility solutions would help enhance the 
    system even further.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommended Future Work</h3>
    <p>
    Future iterations of the containment system should focus on enhancing usability, 
    ergonomics, and maintainability. Stronger, softer seals could improve long-term 
    airtightness, while upgraded gloves would expand operator reach and comfort inside 
    larger enclosures. The modular T-slot design could be refined by sealing grooves 
    or using alternative framing to eliminate contamination points. Finally, adding 
    support structures such as mobile stands or adjustable legs would improve ergonomics, 
    making the system easier and safer to use in operational environments.
