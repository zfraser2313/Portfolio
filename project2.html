    <h2>Open Sauce: Ciggy Shooter</h2>
    <p>
      Open Sauce is a large engineering/science expo put on by Youtuber William Osman. 
      For this expo there are around 500 exhibits where people from the community can build 
      a project and showcase it. There are also panels with the largest STEM Youtubers from, 
      rocketry to AI and anywhere in between. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A friend and I have watched many of these Youtubers for years at this point, and we 
      decided that we wanted to build a project to present. Many of the popular videos are 
      on projects on the "edgier" side of engineering, so we decided to make a project to fit 
      that theme. That is where the idea for the ciggy shooter came up.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Create a face-tracking gun that automatically shoots cigarettes into a mouth from 
      6-8 feet away. The project needed to be safe for the public to use while still 
      being interactive
    </p>

    <h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Effective range of 6-8 feet because of presentation space</li>
      <li>50% mouth hit-rate</li>
      <li>Computing using only a raspberry-pi</li>
      <li>Keep cost under $500</li>
      <li>Get accepted as Open Sauce exhibitors</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>System Design</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3D printed base and gun for weight and cost considderations</li>
      <li>Raspberry pi 4B used to run face-tracking and shooting capabilities</li>
      <li>Servo motors used for pan and tilt motion</li>
      <li>DC mototrs used in a flywheel configuration for launch</li>
      <li>Standard USB webcam for vision</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Key Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Accepted as exhipitors to Open Sauce</li>
      <li>All computing done with a raspberry pi</li>
      <li>From 6-8 feet the device hit a mouth 60% of the time</li>
      <li>Cost: Under $400</li>
      <li>Over 500 people tried the ciggy shooter</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
    One of the most difficult problems was how unstable cigarettes are in flight. 
    Because cigarettes are so light to stay accurate they need to be moving 
    quickly through the air, but because they are made of paper getting them 
    up to that speed can tear them apart. So with speed adjustments and 
    changing the flywheel material to TPU we were able to find a middle ground 
    where the cigarettes were lauched fairly straight while remaining intact.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
    Overall this was a fun project because neither my friend or I had worked with 
    a rasperry pi orany face-tracking software before, and we were still able to get 
    the project to meet our expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Going to Open Sauce was a great experiance, and It was fun to see how many 
      people love to build things for the sake of building things. We were able to 
      meet a lot of STEM creators who enjoyed the project and gave suggestions for 
      improving the ciggy shooter. I would recomend going to Open Sauce even if you 
      don't build a project.
