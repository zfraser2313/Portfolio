        This portfolio has recently been created, and more in depth descriptions 
        with pictures will be added soon.

      <p>
        I am an Aerospace Engineering Master's student at Utah State Univerity 
        with a focus on Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Engineering (GN&C). 
        I also have a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. During my undergrad 
        I worked in various engineering roles, as well as in leadership for the American 
        Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) student section on campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school and work I enjoy building random personal projects. 
        I use these projects as a way to learn new skills, and to have fun with 
        the engineering skills I have learned.
